## Frameworks

### To import and setup
1. Using 'pip install django' to setup virtual enviornment
2. Using 'python -m pip install django-cors-headers' to import cors-headers request
3. And import pymysql through the code 'import pymysql' 

## Getting Started
I recommend using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to install the project's dependencies.

Follow the following steps to set-up a virtual environment and install the required python modules:

1. From this directory, run the following command to create a virtual environment named **venv**. This will create a folder named **venv** which will contain your virtual environment.
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

2. Now, activate the virtual environment by running the following command in this directory:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Now, use pip to install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. To test if you have successfully installed the project dependencies, run the django development server and verify it works.
First `cd` into the `django-site` directory, and then attempt to start the django development server.
```
cd django-site
python manage.py runserver
```

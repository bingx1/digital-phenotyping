# Backend
This directory contains all the backend related source files for the project.

## Frameworks
- [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/)

## Getting Started
I recommend using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to install the project's dependencies.

Follow the following steps to set-up a virtual environment and install the required python modules:

1. From this directory, run the following command to create a virtual environment named **venv**:
`python3 -m venv venv`

2. There should now be a folder named **venv** in thie directory if step 1 was done correctly. Now, activate the virtual environment by running the following command in this directory:
`source venv/bin/activate`

3. Now, use pip to install the dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
